Taught pulp_rpm to respond gracefully when CONTENT_ORIGIN is not set.

NOTE: Without CONTENT_ORIGIN, the plugin cannot autogenerate config.repo for a repository
unless a config-repo JSON has been provided which contains baseurl. Without CONTENT_ORIGIN
or a baseurl, requests for config.repo will return a 404.
